# Prediction of Selling price for used Cars by-building Machine learning model using-Python (Linear Regression & Lasso Regression)

**Problem Statement:**  
* Prediction of Selling price of used Car by using available dataset features like year of purchase, KM running, no. of owners, fuel type etc.

**Source:** This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com

**Data Overview:**
The dataset contains information about used cars. This data is used for price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning. The columns are Name, year, selling price, km driven, fuel, seller type, transmission, owner.


**Model Building and Training:**
* This is a Regression dataset. We are building a model using Linear Regression & Lasso Regression. 
* ML algorithm is first trained using data that finds patterns in dataset.
* So, whenever we assign the new value to the ML algorithm, it can predict the selling price.
